/**
 * Understanding localStorage: localStorage is a web storage API in JavaScript that allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser. Unlike session storage, localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. It provides a way to store data on the user's browser without any expiration date. This makes it a good option for maintaining data between sessions or for storing preferences, settings, or user-related data.

Using localStorage: To use localStorage, you can access the localStorage object provided by the browser. It has methods like setItem, getItem, removeItem, and clear to manage the data.

Storing Data in localStorage: To store data, use the setItem method, providing a key and its corresponding value as arguments.

localStorage.setItem("key", "value");

Retrieving Data from localStorage: To retrieve data, use the getItem method and provide the key for the value you want to retrieve.

const value = localStorage.getItem("key");

Removing Data from localStorage: To remove data, use the removeItem method and provide the key you want to remove.

localStorage.removeItem("key");

Clearing All Data from localStorage: To clear all data stored in localStorage, use the clear method.

localStorage.clear();
